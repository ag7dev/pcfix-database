# 🌟 How to Perform a Soft Reset (Windows Recovery Reset)

## Step 1: Backup Important Data (Optional but Recommended) 📦
Even though this method can preserve your files, always back up critical data to an external drive or cloud storage to avoid accidental loss.

## Step 2: Open Windows Recovery ⚙️
1. **Go to Settings:**
   - Press `Windows + I` to open Settings.
   - Navigate to **System > Recovery** (Windows 11) or **Update & Security > Recovery** (Windows 10).

2. **Start the Reset Process:**
   - Under Recovery Options, click **Reset PC** (Windows 10/11).

## Step 3: Choose Reset Options 🔄
1. **Select Reset Type:**
   - **Keep my files:** Reinstalls Windows but keeps personal files (apps and settings are removed).
   - **Remove everything:** Deletes all files, apps, and settings (like a factory reset).

   > **Note:** If you’re selling/donating the PC, choose **Remove everything** and enable **Clean the drive** for security.

2. **Confirm Your Choice:**
   - Follow the prompts to confirm your selection. Windows will list apps that will be removed (click **Next** to proceed).

## Step 4: Reinstall Windows 💻
1. **Download Windows:**
   - If connected to the internet, choose **Cloud Download** (faster) or **Local Reinstall** (uses existing files).
   > **Note:** Cloud Download requires a stable internet connection.

2. **Begin the Reset:**
   - Click **Reset** and wait. Your PC will restart multiple times (this may take 20–60 minutes).

## Step 5: Post-Reset Setup 🛠️
1. **Set Up Windows:**
   - After the reset, configure your region, language, and user account (like a new PC).

2. **Restore Files:**
   - If you chose **Keep my files**, your personal data will be in a folder named **Windows.old** on the C: drive (copy what you need, then delete the folder to free space).
